# musicdb_builder
music database builder using python with lxml and requests

There are 4 scripts in all:

1. get_artists.py          - builds the artists table
2. get_artist_to_albums.py - builds the album table
3. get_album_to_songs.py   - build songs
4. get_song_to_lyrics.py   - completes lyrics

the entire process generates 3 tables as follows:

Artists title
Albums title,year
Songs title,lyrics
